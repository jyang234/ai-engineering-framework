# Session Summary

## Accomplished
- Added 2 new skills: `refactoring-planning` and `scaffolding-tests`
- Updated agent frontmatters: architect (+refactoring-planning), coder (+scaffolding-tests), edi-test-writer (+scaffolding-tests)
- Fixed pre-existing gap: wired up `coding` and `testing` skills with embed directives and install logic (all 6 skills now embedded + installed)
- Refactored `installEdiCoreSkill`/`installRetrievalJudgeSkill` into generic `installSkill` helper
- Created `edi sync` command for lightweight asset-only updates (no config/recall overwrites)
- Added `make sync` (build + install + sync assets) and `make reinstall` (clean rebuild + full init) Makefile targets
- Fixed `make sync` hang: switched from `$(HOME)/.local/bin/edi` to `./bin/edi` in Makefile

## Key Decisions
- `edi sync` as separate command — cleaner than adding flags to `init`, single responsibility
- Use `./bin/edi` in Makefile targets — avoids stale installed binary triggering `syscall.Exec` into Claude Code
- Generic `installSkill(home, name, fs)` — reduces duplication now that there are 6 skills

## Open Items
- No tests written for `edi sync` command
- Codex Makefile does not exist yet (only EDI has one)
